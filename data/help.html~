<h1><u>Basics</u></h1>

<p><b>
Lasertag3D is a multi-player game of laser tag where gravity is optional.
The object of the game is to get the most points by shooting other players and not getting shot yourself.
   For each hit made, you gain 3 points, and for each hit taken, you lose 1.
</b></p>
<p><b>To shoot, click where you want to shoot.
  You can only shoot 2 beams per second.
</b></p>
<p><b>When you hit someone or are hit, you will hear a noise and a message will appear in your sidebar telling you what happened.
</b></p>

<h1><u>Explore</u></h1>

<p><b>
There are two different game modes accessable from the main menu: Explore (single-player) and Lasers+People (multi-player).
</b></p>
<p><b>
In Explore mode, you are by yourself exploring a scene.
  This is useful for learning the controls and learning about the scenes.
  Additionally, if you choose a maze scene, you are basically in a graphically enhanced version of the game

<h1><u>Lasers+People</u></h1>
<p><b>
In Lasers+People mode, you can play with other people through the Internet.
  After you click on this menu option, you will see several tabs.
  Each tab is named after a scene; each scene's tab contains a list of all the games that people are trying to start in that scene.
  You can join someone else's game, get information about other games, or start your own.
</b></p>
<p><b>If you want to find the ping from your computer to a certain game's server, you must select the game and then press the "Ping Server" button.
  After a second or so, the ping (in milliseconds) will show up in the selected game's description.
  During a game, the ping will show itself as the time between when you do something (move, shoot, etc.) and when you see its effects.  Lower is better.
</b></p>
<p><b>If you create or join a game that is taking a while to start because not enough players are joining, use the "Request Start" button to request that the game starts with the players you have so far.
  The other players who already joined will be asked if they want to start or not; once enough of them approve/disapprove, either the game will start or you will be told that your request was rejected.
  A 2/3 majority is required for a start request to be accepted.

<h1><u>Settings</u></h1>
<p><b>
The settings are grouped into 3 tabs: General, Key Bindings, and Network.
</b></p>
<p><b>
The General tab lets you set your screen name, the field of view, and the mouse sensitivity.
<br />  Your screen name is the name that others will see when joining or playing in multi-player games.
<br />  The field of view controls how wide your virtual sight is, in degrees.
  Higher values let you see more, but they also distort the view slightly.
  Lower values show more detail but let you see less.
  The default value of 90 degrees is the most realistic looking.
<br />  The mouse sensitivity controls how quickly you rotate.
</b></p>
<p><b>
The Key Bindings tab is self-explanatory.
</b></p>
<p><b>
The Network tab is for configuring your computer to host multiplayer games.
